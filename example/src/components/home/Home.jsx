            Under the legal terminology of Ancient Rome, the names "Numerius Negidius" and
            "Aulus Agerius" were used in relation to hypothetical defendants and plaintiffs.

            The name "John Doe" (or "John Doo"), "Richard Roe," along with "John Roe", were
            regularly invoked in English legal instruments to satisfy technical requirements
            governing standing and jurisdiction, beginning perhaps as early as the reign of
            England's King Edward III (1327â€“1377). Though the rationale behind the choice
            of Doe and Roe are still unknown with many suggested folk etymologies. Other
            fictitious names for a person involved in litigation in medieval English law were
            "John Noakes" (or "Nokes") and "John-a-Stiles" (or "John Stiles"). The Oxford
            English Dictionary states that John Doe is "the name given to the fictitious lessee
            of the plaintiff, in the (now obsolete in the UK) mixed action of ejectment, the
            fictitious defendant being called Richard Roe".
